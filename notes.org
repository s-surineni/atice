* to find the total sign in list of arrays in the problem [[https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/discuss/1152555/Java-solution-0-ms-Seriously-why-we-need-2][leet sign of product array]] this is used instead of storing num of neg values
#+begin_src python
if n < 0:
    n = -n
#+end_src
* dynamic programming
** it can also be thought of as a procedural way to build solutions to bigger problems from simpler problems
*** for example coin change
** we consider solutions to all possible combinations of problems this way
*** example coin change problem
**** even though we don't want number of ways to form smaller sums, we do it as it is part of larget sum
